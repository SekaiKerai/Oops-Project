Kunal changes - 28/04/2025
price - no function overrriing / was not being used
removing things we dont know and not used in program:
    removed the class of exception(in-built)

Read :
    Tuktuk -> base price = 20.0 , perkm = 10.0
    Taxi -> base price = 100.0, perkm = 40.0

Things new:
    virtual ~RentalVehicle() = default; - when using virtual functions in base class, its good to call a virtual destructor to prevent memory leaks
    string getType() const { return type; } - why const? when called, only read , no updation of field
    stringstream -> extract number from a string safely
    unique_ptr -> no other pointer points to the current object
    static_cast (used in book cab) - locations is vector<locations> so to convert size of location struct to int
    const_cast (used to update driverlocation after booking) - lat,lon is const so const_cast removes this and allows change of lat,lon 

----------------------TO DO------------------------------
viewdriverbooking test
*** removing reset driver location at 4am? - updating start location should be done in originaldrivers, newdrivers also should be in original drivers
manual option check
if you want you can show owner contact in rental history
